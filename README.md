Modifying starter code to create an application that enables employees to genrate random passwords.
The generate password button will activate a number of prompts when clicked.
Prompts will inform the users about the required password standard e.g. length and character types. 
Should the users input be invalid, an alert will pop up clarifying the reason why and request the user to start over.
Once all prompts are addressed ans the chosen password matches the required standard, the password will be displayed on the page.
